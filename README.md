# FAO slides

*LaTeX package to create slides in FAO format*

## User guidelines

To use the **fao** LaTeX package, place `fao.sty` and the `figs` folder in the
working directory - or [install](INSTALL.md) in a fixed location where LaTeX can
find it.

Compile [demo.tex](doc/demo.tex) to see the basic functionality.
